To make a docker container, here are some things:

1. Make a file called “Dockerfile”: which contains this text:

FROM tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu
RUN apt-get -y update && apt-get -y upgrade
RUN pip3 install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn torch
RUN mkdir /code
WORKDIR /code


2.For each python package to install into the docker container, changes that pip3 command to add more or less packages.

3.The purpose for this is mainly to install packages that aren’t on the server along with enabling GPU’s

Afterwards, inside the directory where the Dockerfile is stored, run these commands in order:

mkdir -p code
docker build -t tf .
docker run --gpus all -it -v $(pwd)/code:/code --rm tf bash

a. Now you’re in the docker container, any file inside of the ‘code’ directory will be ported over to the docker container, and any python file can be run inside of the docker through python3.
python3 main.py

4. From second time just run:
docker build -t tf .
docker run --gpus all -it -v $(pwd)/code:/code --rm tf bash
